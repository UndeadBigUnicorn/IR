How is the document frequency df of a term used to scale its weight?
Denoting as usual the total number of documents in a collection by N, we define
the inverse document frequency (idf) of a term t as follows:
idf(t) = log (N/df(t))

The tf-idf weighting scheme assigns to term t a weight in document d given
by
tf-idf(t,d) = tf(t,d) × idf(t)

As a first step, we introduce the overlap score measure: the score of a document d is the
sum, over all query terms, of the number of times each of the query terms
occurs in d. We can refine this idea so that we add up not the number of
occurrences of each query term t in d, but instead the tf-idf weight of each
term in d.
Score(q, d) = ∑ tf-idf(t,d)
              t∈q
